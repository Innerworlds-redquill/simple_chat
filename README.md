# Simple Chat

## What is this?

- Simple Chat allows you to describe who you want to chat with, then start an AI chat with them

## What to do?

### Step 1: Make the app actually work

- the basic ui is there so you don't have to make it from scratch but the functionality doesn't work!
- feel free to change/upgrade the UI however you want, i just made it so you don't have to start completely from scratch. you can use any additional libraries or anything else you want if needed
- you can use whatever LLM you want. I reccocmend going on open router and picking one from there so you can easily test a bunch. Message me for an api key

### Step 2: Add a fun feature to the app

- there's a billion chat apps out there, add a fun feature that will set your chat app apart!

### Step 3: Write a short list of what else you would do if you had to make this a full feature

## What am i looking for?

- can you quickly write high quality code
- do you know how to work with LLMs
- how cool is your fun feature?
